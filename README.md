# Project-Transcriber
Project Transcriber is a Chrome Extension will create a YouTube transcript using NPL and making a request to a REST API. 

# Project Context
I created this project due to the landscape of online learning. Recently, professfors have been posting their videos online, for students who can not make it to class. But I feel like these videos may have irrelevant information. So, I wanted to make a tool that summarizes trascript of such videos and allows students to look for the important infomration they need at a faster rate. This tool is designed to save students time and efforts, and to maximize studying time.
